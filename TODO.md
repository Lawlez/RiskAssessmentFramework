### Requirement 
## Important Selection Criteria

  - Requirement: Must support your programming language, but not usually
    a key factor once it does.
  - Types of vulnerabilities it can detect (out of the [OWASP Top
    Ten](OWASP_Top_Ten "wikilink")?) (plus more?)
  - How accurate is it? False Positive/False Negative rates?
      - Does the tool have an OWASP [Benchmark](Benchmark "wikilink")
        score?
  - Does it understand the libraries/frameworks you use?
  - Does it require a fully buildable set of source?
  - Can it run against binaries instead of source?
  - Can it be integrated into the developer's IDE?
  - How hard is it to setup/use?
  - Can it be run continuously and automatically?
  - License cost for the tool. (Some are sold per user, per org, per
    app, per line of code analyzed. Consulting licenses are frequently
    different than end user licenses.)
